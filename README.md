## How has number of rides and average trip duration changed between 2019 and 2020, the year of the COVID-19 lockdown in the U.S. Why could this be the case?


To see how bike usage has changed during the year the pandemic kicked off in the United States, we can look at how the number of rides and average trip duration differed between 2019 (a non-pandemic year) and 2020 when the pandemic kicked off in March.

From the first graph, we can see that 2020 (the light blue line) started off higher than 2019 for total rides by month, but in March, the number of rides per month dropped sharply and remained lower than 2019 for the remainder of the year. We could speculate that the reason for less rides was the lockdown forcing people to stay home. Therefore, they had less place to go and less need for the bikes. 

However, outdoor activities like biking were deemed safer than most indoor activities during the pandemic, so one could have also speculated the bikes would be used more. Based on total rides though, this was not the case. 

Conversely, Based one average ride duration the bikes seemed to be enjoyed quite a bit during 2020. From the graph on the right, we can see that average ride duration by month was higher for all of 2020 than 2019, and spiked  significantly in March of 2020 when the pandemic began. 

The trends shown in the graph might imply that people are using the bikes for longer, leisurely rides, rather than commuting to and from many different places. 



## What percentage of trips were by customers and subscribers for each of 2019 and 2020? What does this tell us?

8.82% of rides were by customers in 2019 and 24.11% were by customers in 2020. Despite the fact that the total of all rides was less in 2020 than 2019, the rides by customers increased by about 92.78%, almost doubling from 34,015 in 2019  to 65,574 in 2020.

On the other hand, the number of subscriber rides has fallen from 351,734 in 2019 to 206,380 in 2020, a 41.13% decrease. The 29.95% decrease in all rides between the 2 years was much less than the decrease in subscriber rides.

Therefore we can see usage by subscribers has suffered, and usage by customers has improved during pandemic.

We can also see from the horizontal bar graphs, that for each station, subscribers take shorter rides, and non-subscribers take longer rides on average. This aligns with the idea that subscribers are riding bikes to get from one place to another rather than enjoying longer rides like customers may be doing. In other words subscribers might use the bikes for functionality and customers might use them for entertainment. Additionally, riders that are not from New York likely wouldn’t want a subscription. They’re more likely one-time customers that might use the bikes for touring the city, and may be taking many detours or getting lost, leading to longer ride times. The horizontal bar graphs also show the stations that each type of rider goes to the most. This information could be used to promote subscriptions to non-subscribers, or advertise to tourists.


## From the 2 maps, we can see the most/least popular start and end stations. 

Grove Street Path seems to be one of the most popular start stations, as well as one of the most popular end stations. However, there are quite a few more bike leaving from the station than arriving to it-  there are about 15,000 less bikes arriving there as an end station throughout all of 2019 and 2020. 

Anther popular station is Hamilton Park. The start and end trip are almost equal for this station  35,816 and 34,420 respectively. 

Additionally, for the top five start stations, they are all the top 5 end stations, and have roughly the same number of bike trips, give or take a little, throughout all of 2020 and 2019 combined. The top five stations can seen by using the sliding filter for number of trips on each map.
